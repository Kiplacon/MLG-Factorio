Version: 69.420.1337
Date: 4/25/2020
  Changes:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 69.420.101
Date: 1/28/2022
  Additions:
    - Kill Streak Counter, the higher the kill streak, the bigger the rainbow aura grows and the more memes spawn per kill.
    - The ability to press F to pay respects on a player corpse.
    - Meme Magazine tier 2. Just deals more damage.
  Changes:
    - Changed sounds form playing at a location to playing with a sticker that gets applied to whatever is dealing meme damage. Apparently something changed with how Factoiro does sounds cause now sounds stay where they are when played.
    - Glow aura now grows infinitely
    - Changed some settings, volume is now a startup setting because stickers just work like that
